# The Roadmap

This is a full roadmap, from zero to hero, to become a Software Engineer.

## No coding experience? No problem

There are many great resources for learning the basics of programming. 

* Choose ONE programming language: Any programming language is fine, as long
as you stick to it. My recomendations are:
    * Python
    * Go
    * Java
    * C/C++
    * JavaScript
!!! note
    There are many other programming languages you can use, but these are the 
    ones that will be mentioned in this roadmap. After all, if you truly 
    understand the concepts learned, you will be able to translate them from 
    language to language.

* Follow a guide to set up your development environment for the language chosen.
There is no need to go too far with it, as long as you can make a "Hello World"
program.

* Follow a course to learn the basics. Make sure you understand:
    * Input and output.
    * Data types
        * Integers.
        * Floating point numbers.
        * Characters and strings of characters.
        * Boolean: true or false values.
    * Variables
    * Flow control:
        * If, else, else if
        * For loops, while loops

!!! note
    I am planning to build a guide to also cover this section, but as of now, 
    I'll link to existing FREE resources you can follow to get started with 
    programming.

After learning these concepts, you can build many, many things already.
